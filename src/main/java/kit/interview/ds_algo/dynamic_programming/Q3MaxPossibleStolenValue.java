There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to
steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the
owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and right side. What is the maximum
stolen value?

Input: {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19 -> {6, 1, 8, 4}
